<h2>GPATS Climatology box plots</h2>

<p> This analysis is based on historical/archive <a href="http://www.gpats.com.au/home">GPATS data</a>
 over a 10 year periods. The data for each station is based on a 10NM by 10NM box
 centred on station lat long.
 This is to conform to the definition of what an observation is by including a
 'vicinity' area that goes out to 18km. (Ideally need a 10nm radius circle,
 but the box should be a close approximation).
 For the purpose of this study we need only one lightning strike inside the 'box'
 to declare a given calendar date/day as a thunder day.
 Note that a calendar day here is taken as from 00:00 to 23:59 UTC
 (quite close to our field book reporting - 9am to 9am (23Z to 23Z) but then
 we also have definition for calendar day for some climatology parameters and forecasts as
 from midnight to midnight (14Z to 14Z). Addressing this would require some extra work!!!
</p>

 <p> With respect to how well gpats verifies with observations from manual or staffed stations,
  an analysis for Brisbane shows general agreement between the two, although given that
  gpats data has a fairly short (~ 10 year) history, the thunder day counts would be smaller.
  Notice that different complimentary techniques were used to identify thunderstorms at a station.
  For stations with human observers (manned stations) we not only have access to mandatory
  present weather groups but also observer remarks/comments on storms/lightning in general
  area but not at airport itself </p>

<br>
<p>
  Below we have two plots for Brisbane Airport . On the left we have total thunder days (over 10 year period)
  by months. To remove bias due to shorter length of GPATS records,
  we can normalise data by diving monthly thunder counts by annual thunder day totals identified using each of the method.
  This would give us percentage contribution to annual thunder day totals by each month.
  - the plot for this on the right shows that storms days captured/indentified by GPATS is very similar to that
  obtained by a human observer at staffed station. <br>

<p>This shows that regardless of method of TS signature detection at Brisbane airport,</p>
<ul>
<li>Dec is the most active TS month, accounting for about 16-18% of annual total, </li>
<li>Jan, Oct and Nov about 12-16%, then </li>
<li>Feb, Mar and Sep 8-10%</li>
</ul>

<p>Interesting small May peak against decreasing trend from Dec/Jan to July!!!
Increasing frequency of cold upper troughs April into May while the low levels are still relatively warm
and humid leads to higher lapse rates - thus bit more instability and thus more storm!!

</p>
<p>July is least active, JJA together is quietest 3 months, although Aug activity is simillar to April.</p>

    <h3> GPATS heatmaps over TS Genesis area.</h3>
    <p><em>(feature request from Sam)</em><br>
    These hourly heatmaps on Google Earthâ„¢ backgrounds are intended to show evolution and movement of 
    storms in both time and space on historical/past days that match current synoptic pattern (MSLP, upper steering winds and temps) <br>

    Due insufficient storage for gpats data on server and few issues with generating lightning data heatmap
    on the fly on pythonanywhere.com, these heatmapss at the moment are just static displays for one afternoon on Dec 2016,
    when storms affected the Sunshine Coast.
