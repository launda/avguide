<h2>Fog Climatology plots</h2>

<p> These analysis and plots were completed during Spring 2015 while I was learning to use ggplot on 
    <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R package</a> - so few years old but still handy fallback.
    Best to download to your computer and open in your favourite PDF viewer.</p
